# Perpendicular Bisector Trace
## Introduction
Perpendicular Bisector Trace is a Java program that allows for the visualization of interesting surfaces generated by tracing the perpendicular bisector of a line segment connecting a specified, fixed point and another point moving according to a parametric function. This is an extension of a Wolfram Demonstrations Project (linked below) that I wrote that makes arbitrary-resolution renders of these surfaces. 

## Configuration
Configuration is done by modoifying the static variables found in PerpTrace.java. 

The parametric function being traced can be set my modifying the contents of static methods ``dx`` and ``dy``. The parameter is a double named ``param``. 

The fixed point can be set by changing the initialization values for ``pivot``. 

## Usage
To use, run ``make all``. The result will be an uncompressed image ``out.tiff`` in the parent directory.
